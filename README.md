# Excel-Interactive-Dashboard-for-Tech-Sales-Data

This project is an analysis of sales data from two tech stores (Computech and MicroWorld), covering the first half of 2017. The data set covers a wide range of products including computers, cameras, memory cards and more, providing a detailed overview of sales performance for each store.

The analysis has been presented in an engaging and easy-to-understand dashboard format using Excel, allowing for a clear and concise view of the data from both stores. The user-friendly interface of the dashboard allows for easy manipulation of the data, with slicers and filters available to view the data from different perspectives and compare performance between the two stores.

The dashboard will not only help to identify the top-selling products for each store, but will also provide various other insights to assist with the business decision making process.

The following dataset was used for this project: **Tech-Sales-Data-Set.xlsx**
